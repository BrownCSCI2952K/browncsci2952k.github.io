                    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/orientation/academic-student-conduct-codes" target="_blank">Brown Academic and Student Conduct Codes</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For programming assignments in this course, feel free to discuss problems, ideas, and course material with other students in the class. However, showing, copying, or any other form of sharing actual code is not permitted. You may use third-party software, data, or other resources, as long as they do not provide the solution directly. You must properly cite them (i.e. in your assignment README) and clearly state what work is your own. As a general policy (for this course and for the rest of your academic career): if you use any idea, text, code, or data from elsewhere, then cite it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Electronics Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The use of electronic devices in class---including laptops, tablets, and mobile phones---is discouraged, except as part of specific in-class exercises or to look up and share something relevant to an in-class discussion. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html" target="_blank">Research shows</a> that students who take notes via laptop do not retain information as well as those who take hand-written notes, and that using a laptop distracts not only you but those around you as well.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Accommodations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Please inform me if you have a disability or other condition that might require accommodations or modification of any of these course procedures. You may email me, come to office hours, or speak with me after class, and your confidentiality is respected. We will do whatever we can to support accommodations recommended by SEAS. For more information contact <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/accessibility-services/" target="_blank">Student and Employee Accessibility Services (SEAS)</a> at 401-863-9588 or <a href="mailto:SEAS@brown.edu" target="_blank"> SEAS@brown.edu</a>. Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact one of the deans in the Dean of the College office.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Mental Health</h2>
                    <p>
                        Being a student can be very stressful. If you feel you are under too much pressure or there are psychological issues that are keeping you from performing well at Brown, we encourage you to contact Brown's <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/counseling-and-psychological-services/" target="_blank"> Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a>. They provide confidential counseling and can provide notes supporting extensions on assignments for health reasons.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Incomplete Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        We expect everyone to complete the course on time. However, we certainly understand that there may be factors beyond your control, such as health problems and family crises, that prevent you from finishing the course on time. If you feel you cannot complete the course on time, please discuss with the instructor the possibility of being given a grade of Incomplete for the course and setting a schedule for completing the course in the upcoming year.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Diversity & Inclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our intent is that this course provide a welcoming environment for all students who satisfy the prerequisites. Our TAs have undergone training in diversity and inclusion, and all members of the CS community, including faculty and staff, are expected to treat one another in a professional manner. If you feel you have not been treated in a professional manner by any of the course staff, please contact either the instructor, Ugur Cetintemel (Dept. Chair), Tom Doeppner (Vice Chair) or Laura Dobler (diversity & inclusion staff member). We will take all complaints about unprofessional behavior seriously. Prof. Krishnamurthi has good notes on this area. To access student support services and resources, and to learn more about diversity and inclusion in CS, please visit <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/resources/" target="_blank">this webpage</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brown welcomes students from all around the country and the world, and their unique perspectives enrich our learning community. To empower students whose first language is not English, an array of support is available on campus, including language and culture workshops and individual appointments. For more information, contact the English Language Learning Specialists at ellwriting@brown.edu.
                    </p>

                    <p><i>Thanks to Tom Doeppner, Laura Dobler, James Tompkin, and Daniel Ritchie for the text on accommodation, mental health, and incomplete policy.</i>
